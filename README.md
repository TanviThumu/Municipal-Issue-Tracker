# Municipal-Issue-Tracker
A backend web application that allows users to register, log in, and publicly post complaints to municipal authorities (e.g., road damage, sanitation issues). Built using Node.js, Express, EJS, and SQL. Users can manage their own complaints (create, edit, delete) and view all posts sorted by most recent.
